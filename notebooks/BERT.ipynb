Unlike previous architectures that relied on recurrence (Recurent Neural Networks), the Transformer's context-capturing mechanism is built entirely on self-attention mechanisms, allowing for faster training and better handling of long-range dependencies. This innovation laid the foundation for modern models like BERT and GPT, making attention-based architectures the new standard in deep learning for NLP."

        "However, a fundamental challenge in NLP is that computers **cannot** process *raw* text **directly** - they operate on **numerical** data. This means that any text input must first be transformed into a numerical representation. Early approaches relied on simple techniques like **one-hot encoding** or **TF-IDF**, but these methods failed to capture more nuanced **semantically**-rich relationships between words. To address this, more advanced techniques called **embeddings** were developed, mapping words to **dense** (not one-hot-encoded) vector representations that encode semantic meaning. The various directions in the constructed vector space can, therefore, encode some form of meaning in their directions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even so, traditional (non-neural) embeddings like **Word2Vec** or **GloVe** assign a **fixed** vector to each word, ignoring context (for example, \"stick\" has a different meaning in the sentence \"stick to it\" than in \"my dog found a nice stick in the park\"). This limitation led to the development of **contextual** embeddings, where the representation of a word **dynamically** changes based on its surrounding words - an approach central to Transformer-based models like BERT."
